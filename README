== English Word Sanitizer

Simple Sinatra application for crawling a website looking for the 50 most common words (can be changed in the UI)

== Getting Started

1. Run the following command:
  - ruby hello.rb
  - navigate to http://localhost:4567/

2. Explanation:
  - Depth - is how many levels to crawl the site.  Default is 1 (only one link level)
  - Start/End page - just in case there are more than 10000 total links (yikes!)
  - Words - 50 most commmon words to look for (as defined by some site that I found in google)
  - Site - the non-English site you want to crawl looking for English words
